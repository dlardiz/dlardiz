# Mental Quantum Cognition (MQC) – Open Source Project

**Welcome to the MQC Open-Source Initiative — a frontier project in consciousness technology.**  
We are building a modular, open-source hardware + software platform designed to stabilize and enhance Mental Quantum Acuity through adaptive AI, biometric sensing, sound resonance, and cognitive feedback.

## Project Mission

The MQC Project aims to bridge neuroscience, quantum physics, sound, and AI into a real-time feedback system that helps individuals enter and sustain enhanced mental states. This is not metaphysical speculation — it's the beginning of a new human interface with consciousness itself.

> At the core lies the MQC Field Code Equation:  
> **Ψᴍ = ƒ(ΔΦ, Bχ, Cʳ, Tʜ, Sᴄ) × AI(t)**  
> A multidimensional equation modeling coherence across brainwave patterns, biochemical states, symbolic cognition, harmonic audio input, and adaptive AI.

## Core Modules

Each module of the system corresponds to a component of the Field Code Equation:

- **Neural Resonance Interface (NRI)** – EEG capture and brainwave phase analysis  
- **Biochemical State Monitor (BSM)** – HRV, GSR, and hormonal data input  
- **Cognitive Resonance Engine (CRE)** – NLP/LLM-based coherence analysis from journaling/speech  
- **Tonal Harmonic Driver (THD)** – Audio + piezo-based harmonic feedback to induce resonance  
- **Signal Clarity Evaluator (SCE)** – Real-time field coherence score  
- **AI Core (AI-Core)** – The adaptive orchestrator of the system

## MVP Overview

We are beginning with a **Minimum Viable Prototype** that integrates:
- EEG input from OpenBCI or Muse
- HRV monitoring (e.g., Polar H10)
- AI-powered feedback via GPT + real-time journal/voice analysis
- Adaptive tone generator using Streamlit interface and piezo feedback

See [`docs/mvp_plan.md`](./docs/mvp_plan.md) for detailed build stages and goals.

## Get Involved

We are calling on:
- **Neurohackers** (EEG, BCI, neurofeedback)
- **AI Tinkerers** (LLMs, GPT, ML engineers)
- **Resonance Explorers** (biofield, vibrational therapy)
- **Software + Hardware Developers**
- **Documentation Builders + Designers**
